        Introduction
    </h1>
    <p>Factoring polynomials is a fundamental skill that allows us to simplify and solve equations. Factoring is the process of expressing a polynomial as a product of simpler polynomials. This guide will cover three important topics in factoring:</p>

    <li>
        1. Factoring by GCF (Greatest Common Factor)
    </li>
    <li>
        2. Factoring by Grouping
    </li>
    <li>
        3. Factoring Basic Trinomials
    </li>
        
        
    
    <p>  
        Additionally, we will explore how to completely factor any factorable polynomial and provide examples for each of the three methods.
        
        
        Definition of Factoring:
        
        
        Factoring is the process of breaking down a polynomial into a product of simpler polynomials or expressions. This simplification helps us solve equations, identify roots, and understand the behavior of polynomial functions.

    <h1>factoring by gcf</h1>
    <p>the greatest common factor is when its the largest factor all numbers share.</p>

<div id="box3">
    <h1>factoring by grouping</h1>
    <p>you factor by grouping when there is a common factor that exists between the groupings</p>
